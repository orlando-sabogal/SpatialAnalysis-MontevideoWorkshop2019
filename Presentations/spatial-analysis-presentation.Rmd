#Statistical models

<br/>

--
- Areal data: Observed variable on zones follows a random process. Spatial Autucorrelation. Modifable areal unit problem MAUP.


--
- Point data:Location as a random process (crimes). Differnce between spatial distribution and completely random spatial distribution. Usually associated with hotspots and Kernel Denstiy Estimation KDE.


--
- Continous data: *Geostatistics.* The variables is continously distributed across all the territory but there are limited discrete-fixed observations. Semivariogram, interpolation, Kriging.


---
#Programming 

- Programming? Writting code? or just *scripting*?

- Always use google. Even the most experimented programmers are all day in stackoverflow or github figuring out how to make things work. 

- I see programming as a superpower. 

- It can certainly foster your work. 

- Reproducible research, government accountability, citizen science. 

- **Empowerment**

- R is a (powerful) tool. Be aware of other tools: *python*, *javascript*, *SQL.*

#Content 

This course is about using data with geographic properties. 
Hopefully, **we will code a lot.**

.pull-left[

###You will learn

- Some general concepts. 
- Key Libraries
- To make reproducible and reusable maps
- That *the sky is the limit*
- Hopefully, **to learn R**.

]

.pull-right[

###You will not learn

- Geographic Statistics and sound methods.
- *raster* data.
- To write efficient R code.<sup>*</sup>
- To handle big data.
- To solve every possible problem.

#libraries

--
There are many libraries. In this course we are going to try to cover the basics apsects of: <br> </br>

--
sf  <br> </br>
--
sf + *The Tidyverse* <br> </br>
--
sf + *The Tidyverse* + notebooks <br> </br>
--
tmap <br> </br>
--
leaflet <br> </br>


---
class: inverse, center, middle

# sf: simple features

---
#Spatial Operations

--
- Read and Write Data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
st_read()
st_write()
```

--
- It works as a tibble with and additional *geometry* variable. You can use almost the whole **Tidyverse**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
SF_Object %>% ...functions()...

filter()
arrange()
group_by()
summarise()
...
```


---
###Some Useful Functions

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(st_geometry())
st_join()
st_union()
st_difference()
st_buffer()
...
```

--
###CRS: Coordinate Reference System
- *geographic* (distance is not in meters)
- *projected* (distance is in meters) 

--
```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_crs()
st_is_longlat()

st_set_crs()
st_transform()
```

#tmap
##(I love it)


---
#A grammar for plots

**tmap** works in a similar way to **ggplot2**. <br/>
Is simple to use. Think about having an empty canvas where you add elements by using **+ tm_SomeFuncion.**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape() + tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape() + tm_dots() + 
  tm_compass() + tm_scale_bar()
```

###Some capabilities:
- Auxiliar maps (insets)
- Interactiviy, connection to Leaflet
- Full customization of legends
- Faceted maps

#Leaflet and Leaflet for R

Originallyl, Leaflet is a javascript [library](https://leafletjs.com/) "...designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind." 

Fortunately, in the [html widgets for R](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) there is a [Leaflet for R](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) that let you use most of the capabilities of Leaflet with your regular R code. To create maps with leaflet you can use *data.frame* objects, *sf* objects, *raster* objects and *json* files. 

Leaflet for R is methodologically easy to use and you can get farther by exploring the arguments of the functions. A nice feature of Leaflet is that is integrated with shiny. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
leaflet() %>% addProviderTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons() %>% 
  addCircles() %>% 
  ...
```

- [Water Quality](https://udwq.shinyapps.io/lakeprofiledashboard/)
- [SpatialEpiApp](https://paulamoraga.shinyapps.io/spatialepiapp/)
- Is actually an [R package](https://paula-moraga.github.io/blog/2018/01/04/2018-01-04_spatialepiapp/) too.
