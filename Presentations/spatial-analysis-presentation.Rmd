#Statistical models

- Areal data: Observed variable on zones follows a random process. Spatial Autucorrelation. Modifable areal unit problem MAUP.

- Point data:Location as a random process (crimes). Differnce between spatial distribution and completely random spatial distribution. Usually associated with hotspots and Kernel Denstiy Estimation KDE. 

- Continous data: *Geostatistics.* The variables is continously distributed across all the territory but there are limited discrete-fixed observations. Semivariogram, interpolation, Kriging.

#Programming 

- Programming? Writting code? or just *scripting*?
- Always use google. Even the most experimented programmers are all day in stackoverflow or github figuring out how to make things work. 
- I see programming as a superpower. 
- It can certainly foster your work. 
- Reproducible research, government accountability, citizen science. 
- **Empowerment**
- R is a (powerful) tool. Be aware of other tools: *python*, *javascript*, *SQL.*

#Content 

This course is about using data with geographic properties. 

.pull-left[

###You will learn

- Some general concepts. 
- Key Libraries
- To make reproducible and reusable maps
- That *the sky is the limit*
- Hopefully, **to learn R**.

]

.pull-right[

###You will not learn

- Geographic Statistics and sound methods.
- *raster* data.
- To write efficient R code.<sup>*</sup>
- To handle big data.
- To solve every possible problem.

#Spatial Operations

- It works as a tibble with and additional *geometry* variable.

#CRS: Coordinate Reference System

Can be:
- *geographic* (distance is not in meters)
- *projected* (distance is in meters) 

Options:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

st_set_crs()
st_transform()

```
