## Montevideo (Uruguay) - June 2019.

This is short course about using geographic data to generate maps and insights. We will see how to use the  **sf** library to load and process data by performing spatial operations. For map-making we are going to introduce the **tmap** library. Also, we will see how to create interactive maps with **leaflet.** <br/>

[Here](Presentations/spatial-analysis-presentation.html) you can find the slides to the introduction. <br/>

Nevertheless, most of the content is going to be delivered through three tutorials:

- [Warm Up - sf](https://orlando-sabogal.github.io/SpatialAnalysis-MontevideoWorkshop2019/Notebooks/WarmUp.nb.html)
- [tmap Tutorial](https://orlando-sabogal.github.io/SpatialAnalysis-MontevideoWorkshop2019/Notebooks/tmap-tutorial.nb.html)
- [Interactive maps](https://orlando-sabogal.github.io/SpatialAnalysis-MontevideoWorkshop2019/Notebooks/InteractiveMaps.nb.html)

I encourage you to go through the Notebooks and digest the code. Eventually, you can forget the detail of every library or how an specific function works; but if you understand the logic and develop the intuition, is easier to remember and to solve new problems.

Please let me know if you find any mistake or have a suggestion.
